//! Platform-independent IceSickle device logic.
//!
//! Three things live here: the attestation itself, at the crate root; the
//! debounced button state machine in [`button`]; and the rate limit in
//! [`cooldown`]. They share one rule — **no hardware, and no clock of their
//! own**. Every reading a decision depends on arrives as a parameter.
//!
//! Everything here is deterministic. Ed25519 signing is deterministic by
//! construction, and postcard encoding is deterministic by requirement, so the
//! only non-deterministic inputs an attestation has are the entropy seed and the
//! clock — and both are **parameters**, supplied by the caller.
//!
//! That is the whole point of this crate. The firmware fills the seed from a
//! [`Trng`]-backed source and the timestamp from a hardware timer; a host test
//! passes fixed bytes and asserts exact signature output. The signing path is
//! therefore fully covered on any machine, with no ESP32 and no emulator —
//! which matters because Espressif's QEMU cannot reach this code at all
//! (`esp_hal::init()` does not return under it; see
//! `docs/NOSTD_ENTROPY_SPIKE.md`).
//!
//! [`button`] and [`cooldown`] are here for the same reason. Their esp-idf
//! ancestors read `esp_timer_get_time()` internally and, in the cooldown's
//! case, kept state in a `static`, so neither could be exercised without an
//! ESP32 and neither had a test worth the name. Taking `now_ms` as an argument
//! is the entire difference between that and the suites in those modules.
//!
//! `no_std` and allocator-free: postcard is built without its `alloc` feature,
//! so `to_allocvec` is unreachable and a signed payload cannot end up on a heap.
//!
//! [`Trng`]: https://docs.rs/esp-hal/latest/esp_hal/rng/struct.Trng.html
